<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Jhon Wick</h3>
<p>The best action movie.The film's mythology of a criminal underworld with rituals and rules was praised as its most unique and interesting feature</p>
<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean</h3>
<p>One of the reasons for the first film's success is that it took the classic Hero's Journey and told it again in a new way. People like seeing what they already saw if it is given in a new, original way, and Pirates of the Caribbean succeeded in doing this.
    <br>
    <p>Awesome action and swashbuckling adventure, great music from the likes of Hans Zimmer, good visuals and Johnny Depp's hilarious improvisational performance as Captain Jack Sparrow</p>
